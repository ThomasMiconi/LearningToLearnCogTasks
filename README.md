This is the code for the ICML 2023 paper, "Learning to acquire novel cognitive tasks with evolution, plasticity and meta-meta-learning".

We evolve a recurrent  network, endowed with a reward-modulated Hebbian
plasticity rule, that can  automatically learn simple cognitive tasks from
stimuli and rewards alone. The network is tested on a new task, never seen
during evolution (delayed match-to-sample).
